I would suggest opening the OpenTestBed project in the Eclipse IDE.
Though it may be possible to open it in another IDE, I have no experience
doing so.

1.
Once the OpenTestBed project is downloaded to your hard drive,
open Eclipse IDE. From the project explorer, right click and select "import".

2.
From the import menu, select "existing projects into workspace".

3.
Use the explorer to select the location of the OpenTestBed directory.

4.
Once imported, from the project explorer,
right click on the "Open Meerkat Hold'em Testbed"

5.
Select "run as..." and "java application"

6.
From the list of generated java files, select "MyCashGameConsoleStarter - (default package)"
This will run a set of games as described by the parameters in "MyCashGameConsoleStarter.java"
The default setting is 10,000 games.
Hand history data and model data is stored in the /data/ directory of the project.

7.
To utilize the WEKA toolkit, we will select "Explorer - weka.gui.explorer"
This will present a GUI which allows you to import .arff files which can then be
used to create a model with various classifiers
